I know you have seen and not acknowledging. Fine!
Its you who sent me the mail to contact you.. I tried everyway and you dont even reply be back
I do respect yours mom's words. I wont trouble you anymore. 
But I need one last response from you to know why you made such a bad statement on me.
You know what, many people from our class got to know this, even they could say what you did is a big mistake 
Like completly blaming the other person.
We really want to know your side of the story
A single line reply will make sense. So please! Please if you wish my well-being too then please!

If you had said something else then its fine, its understandable that to escape and make the situation light you would said to amma
but blaming my heath is ridiculous!!
I never had my health as a tool of sympathy etc. If its your way I can also frame it as you took advantage of my health but I dont have a heart to say that.

You already know talking aboubt my health how much does it make me feel bad, worse. Still you did that, marking the complete blame on me.
Even people who all heard the story felt bad, worse, anger on you.
